# Coding fun

A selection of coding experiments that I have developed over the years while learning code. Mostly based on [Daniel Shiffman's The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) and [Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

You can play with some of these [here](https://juanirache.github.io/coding-fun/)
